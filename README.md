## Summary

This research explores how Ukraine developed cyber resilience under conditions of sustained cyber aggression. It applies a learning-based framework combining:

- **Peter Hall's (1993)** theory of third-order policy change  
- **Mark Beissinger's (2002)** concept of emulation under pressure  
- Empirical case studies of critical cyber incidents (BlackEnergy, NotPetya, Kyivstar)

The visual diagram included here illustrates the causal sequence from cyber shock to resilience, highlighting bounded learning and institutional adaptation.
